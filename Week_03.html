                My name is Tayler, I’m 27 years old, and I live in Hammond, Louisiana with my boyfriend and our 3 dogs. I’ve been an LPN for over 4 years now, currently working as an Agency Nurse. Also, my little side hustle is Q Sciences - which is a health & wellness company. I recently started my own Etsy shop focusing on drop shipping, but my goal is to actually produce my own planner brand & start an LLC here in the near future.  I’m pretty much undecided about furthering my nursing education at this point, I literally have all of my perquisites for the RN program, but I can’t honestly say that I want to stay in nursing anymore. It’s so different now, and I’d like to have something of my own either way. So, I guess that brings me to why I’m taking this class. I’m  hoping to just keep absorbing all the knowledge that I can to better my future.
